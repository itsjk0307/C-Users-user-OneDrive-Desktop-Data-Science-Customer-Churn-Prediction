Customer Churn Prediction Project
Description:
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns. The objective was to identify customers likely to leave the company, allowing proactive measures for customer retention. We applied several machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression, to identify key churn indicators.
Key Tools/Technologies:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Outcome:
Our model achieved an accuracy of X% (fill in your result). The insights gained from the analysis can help companies reduce churn by understanding customer behavior and improving service offerings.
